# CLAUDE.md

Instructions for Claude Code or Anthropic-based agents.

Minimal content:
- How to run tests: `npm test`
- Preferred behavior: respond with diffs and short explanations.
- Where to find long-term context: `docs/memory-bank/` and `PRD.md`.

Agents must not assume versions — consult `TECH_STACK.md`.

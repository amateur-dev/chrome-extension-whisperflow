## Current Session
**Goal:** Initialize the "VibeCoding" Memory Bank with accurate, project-specific context.

## Current Focus
- Establishing the "AI Brain" (`docs/memory-bank/`) with accurate, project-specific context.
- Identifying missing implementation details in the MVP code components.

## Recent Changes
- Updated `RULES.md` to enforce Conventional Commits and detailed messages.
- Deleted generic "Vibe Coding" tutorial files.
- Populated `TECH_STACK.md` and `ARCH.md` with real repo analysis (Vanilla JS, MV3, WASM workers).
- Created `productContext.md` derived from `PRD.md`.
- Documented the worker-based architecture in `systemPatterns.md`.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Verify `whisper-worker.js` implementation (it appears to be a placeholder).
- [ ] Verify `service-worker.js` message routing.
- [ ] Investigate `webllm-worker.js` implementation.

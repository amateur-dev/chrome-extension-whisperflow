# RULES

AI and code rules for the repo. Agents should read this first.

Examples:
- Always prefer explicit types where available.
- Commit after every small feature or fix.
- Run lint and tests locally before pushing.
- Never store API secrets in repo; reference env var names.

Add repo-specific conventions (naming, hooks, CI) here.

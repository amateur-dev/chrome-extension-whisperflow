# PLAN

Implementation plan and checkpoints. Update after each 10-minute chunk.

1. Scaffold extension (manifest, popup UI)
2. Wire background worker and permissions
3. Integrate Whisper transcription API
4. Persist transcripts and add playback
5. Add export/sync and E2E tests

Use short, commit-linked entries for each completed step.

fix(core): complete Phase 1-2 implementation with service worker routing and hardening

## What Changed

### Service Worker ↔ Offscreen Communication
- Added `sendToOffscreen()` helper with 2-minute timeout for reliable message passing
- Added `pingOffscreen()` function to check if offscreen document is ready
- Fixed message listener to properly delegate offscreen-targeted messages
- Service worker now relays `TRANSCRIPTION_PROGRESS` to popup for UI updates

### Popup Improvements
- Added listener for `TRANSCRIPTION_PROGRESS` to show model loading %
- Added `updateTranscriptionProgress()` to update transcribing screen
- Added `MAX_RECORDING_DURATION` (5 minutes) with auto-stop to prevent memory issues

### Worker Lifecycle Management
- Added `WORKER_IDLE_TIMEOUT` (5 minutes) in offscreen.js
- Added `terminateWorker()` to free ~200MB RAM when idle
- Added `resetIdleTimer()` called after each transcription

### Whisper Cleanup
- Changed `transcribeWithWhisper()` to throw clear "not implemented" error
- Moonshine is the primary (and only working) transcription engine

## Why
- Fixes broken message routing that prevented transcription from working
- Adds memory management to prevent RAM bloat from idle workers
- Adds recording limits to prevent accidental long recordings
- Provides user feedback during model loading (first-run ~50MB download)

## Files Modified
- service-worker.js: sendToOffscreen(), progress forwarding
- popup.js: Progress listener, recording limit
- offscreen.js: Worker cleanup on idle
- docs/PLAN.md: Updated Phase 1, 2, 4, 5 as complete
- docs/memory-bank/: Updated activeContext, progress

## Testing
- All 34 tests passing (npm run test:all)
- Manual E2E testing recommended: load extension, record, transcribe

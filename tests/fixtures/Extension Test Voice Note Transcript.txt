The digital revolution has dramatically transformed how we communicate, work, and interact with the world around us. From email to instant messaging, social media platforms have fundamentally altered the landscape of personal and professional engagement. Voice to Text technology, a key innovation in this field, leverages complex algorithm and machine learning models to transcribe spoken language into written form in real time. Developers face challenge in accurately interpreting diverse accents, differentiating between homophones like they are, they are, and they're, and correctly applying punctuation such as commas, periods and question marks. This hands on session aims to address these intricacies, providing practical experience in building a robust extension that functions seamlessly across platforms like Gmail, Notion, Slack, LinkedIn, and Google Docs. Demonstrating that advanced functionality can be achieved without relying on external APIs or complex backend setups.

# copilot-instructions

Repository-specific Copilot instructions.

- Read `docs/RULES.md` and `docs/TECH_STACK.md` for style and versions.
- Prefer small, incremental edits; produce diffs.
- When asked to implement a feature, update `docs/memory-bank/activeContext.md` and `docs/PLAN.md` with next steps.
